<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_leg">Ghost leg</a> is a well-known method used to get random results.
    This mechanism has the effect of changing the order in the list.

<pre class="brush: {% if is_js %}javascript{% else %}python{% endif %}">
assert follow_ghost_legs(3, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 2)]) == [3, 2, 1]

<p>
You are given the number of vertical lines and a list of
legs as input values.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the number of vertical lines is 3, then the starting points are 1, 2, and 3 respectively.</li>
    <li>The leg is a tuple of two integers, which represent the two vertical lines connected by the leg.
    (The leg always connects adjacent vertical line).</li>
    <li>The order of legs represents the level at which they are placed (first leg is the top, and last leg is the bottom).</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow the ghost legs and return a list of converted numbers.</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> The number of vertical lines and a list of legs (a integer and a list of tuple of two integers).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> A list of converted numbers (a list of integers).
